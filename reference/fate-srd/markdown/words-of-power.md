The following is an official Fate Core rules supplement, created for John Hoyland as part of a Fate Core Kickstarter commission.

## Magic

To use magic, you need three things. First, you need an aspect representing the fact that you are a practitioner of magic. Something like <em class="aspect">Trained in the Seven Towers Academy</em> could justify your study in the field of magic, for example. Second, you need a high Lore skill. Lore is the skill you use to cast magic spells; a higher Lore represents more skill and knowledge in all things magical, in addition to other types of knowledge, provided you have an appropriate aspect. Finally, you need words.

Magic spells are made up of **words**. Each of the words below is a sphere of influence, an umbrella under which magical effects following a specific theme exist. Each word has three syllables, each increasing in power. Anyone versed in the use of magic can access the first syllable of each word. In order to gain access to the second and third syllables of each word, take the following stunts.

_Student of Magic:_ You have access to the second syllable of all words.
_Master of Magic:_ You have access to the third syllable of all words.

### CASTING A SPELL

When you cast a spell, you must form the spell out of words, fix it in your mind, and speak the spell.

When you **form the spell**, decide what you want the spell to do. Do you want to divert a stream? Force someone to flee? Summon a djinn? Decide what you want to accomplish, then choose all applicable words.

When you **fix the spell in your mind**, you determine which syllables you’ll use and how difficult the spell is to cast. For each word that you put into the spell, look to the syllables you have access to. If the effect you want exist within the bounds of a syllable, add that syllable’s value to the total difficulty of the spell. If it does not, use the next highest syllable; if it doesn’t exist within the third syllable, add +4. Do this for each word within the spell until you have a total value for your spell.

When you **speak the spell**, you say it in a clear voice: spend a fate point and roll Lore.

* If you fail, either the spell does nothing and you get your fate point back or the spell takes effect but has unforeseen (and possibly catastrophic) consequences.
* If you tie, the spell takes effect but has some minor unforeseen consequences.
* If you succeed, the spell takes effect.
* If you succeed with style, the spell takes effect and choose one word: you may cast the spell as if you had used the next highest syllable, even if you don’t have access to it.

### BOOKS AND MATERIAL COMPONENTS

Magicians often use books and material components to aid their spellcasting. In game terms, these are aspects. A book might be a permanent aspect on your character or a situation aspect you created earlier. Material components are usually boosts: you use them once and then they’re gone.

In addition to providing bonuses on spells you cast, you can use a free invocation on a book or component to take the place of the fate point you must spend to cast a spell.

### THE DEFAULT SPELL

Before you add words to a spell, it:

* Affects you or a mortal you touch
* Last for as long as you can see the target
* Has no particular effect
* Provides Mediocre (+0) opposition

If you cast any spell on a creature against its will, add its Will to the opposition of your Lore roll.

### WORDS

#### COMMAND

You can affect a creature’s behavior, forcing it to act in a specific way.

_First Syllable:_ You place a special boost on the creature representing your command. You can use your free invocation only to compel the creature to follow your command, which it can resist by giving you a fate point.

_Second Syllable:_ The aspect you place is a situation aspect rather than a boost, though you can still invoke it once for free.

_Third Syllable:_ If the target resists your command, it takes a mental consequence in its lowest available consequence slot.

#### DISTANCE

You can cast spells at greater range. When you cast a spell without incorporating this word, you can affect only yourself or things you can touch.

_First Syllable:_ You can affect anything you can see.

_Second Syllable:_ You can affect anything you have some sort of sympathetic token for (a lock of hair, a piece of a statue, etc.), regardless of distance.

_Third Syllable:_ You can affect anything, provided you can speak its name.

#### ELEMENT

You can affect the elements: air, earth, fire, water. This word actually represents four different words; if you want to affect two different elements, it counts as two different words.

_First Syllable:_ You can affect elements that have been bounded or constrained in some way by human beings: statues, flames within a lantern, blown breath, a fountain, and so forth.

_Second Syllable:_ You can affect the raw element itself: wild flames, the earth beneath your feet, the air around you, a river, and so forth.

_Third Syllable:_ You can affect elemental creatures made of the element, such as djinn (made of fire) or golems (made of earth).

#### KNOWLEDGE

You can peer through the veil of the cosmos, glimpsing invisible truths. All answers you glean grant you boosts.

_First Syllable:_ You may ask the GM one question; she must answer your question with truthful, helpful information. Without the Time or Distance words, you can only ask about the present in your immediate surroundings.

_Second Syllable:_ You may ask the GM two questions.

_Third Syllable:_ You may ask the GM three questions.

#### LUCK

You can alter someone’s luck, making it more likely that they’ll be lucky or unlucky.

_First Syllable:_ You place a special boost on the target representing the fact that they’re lucky or unlucky. You may invoke it at any while it still exists to either allow the target to experience some fortunate twist of fate (finding a pouch of coins, for example) or minor personal inconvenience (having paint spilled on them). You can pass the invocation of the boost to the target when you cast the spell, if you wish. You cannot alter your own luck.

_Second Syllable:_ You can invoke the boost for more potent effects. The target experiences either a major boon (such as narrowly avoiding being trampled by a horse on the street) or personal setback (losing a large sum of money in a game of chance). You can affect your own luck, but doing so often has unforeseen consequences.

_Third Syllable:_ The boon or tragedy you can cause with your invocation no limit, you can give or take virtually anything to or from the target. You can affect your own luck, and it works almost entirely as intended. Almost.

#### MOVEMENT

You can change the speed at which a thing can move, or even the way in which it can move.

_First Syllable:_ You can grant immobile things the ability to move along the ground. You can also cause a mobile thing to become slow or fast.

_Second Syllable:_ You can grant something the ability to move in a way it could not before. Maybe a fish can now walk, or a carpet fly.

_Third Syllable:_ You can cause something to be somewhere else immediately.

#### PURIFICATION

You can purge things of impurities or even, with more potent spells, damage or injuries.

_First Syllable:_ You can purge nonliving matter of impurities and minor imperfections. This could allow you to purify food or drink, remove minor flaws from a gemstone, or erase the rust from a suit of armor.

_Second Syllable:_ You can purge living creatures of impurities and can repair minor damage to both creatures and objects. In game terms, if a creature or object has a situation aspect or mild consequence denoting injury, poison, disease, or the like, you can remove it.

_Third Syllable:_ You can repair major damage to both creatures and objects. In game terms, this allows you to erase moderate consequences, though severe consequences are still beyond your power.

#### SHAPE

You can affect the shape of a thing, altering it and reshaping it. If the thing you are reshaping is resisting you in any way, add either its Will or Physique to the opposition for your Lore roll.

_First Syllable:_ You can alter cosmetic characteristics of the thing: color, shape, and so forth. You can make a person look slightly different at first glance, but any scrutiny will reveal their identity. In game terms, this creates a situation aspect representing a disguise or alteration of basic appearance, with one free invocation.

_Second Syllable:_ You can alter a thing’s shape more fully, giving it features it didn’t have before. You might give a turtle wings, or change a man into a woman. In game terms, this creates a single situation aspect with up to three free invocations, or multiple situation aspects with up to three free invocations between them. These situation aspects can grant new abilities, such as the ability to breathe under water or fly, but doing so does not come naturally to the creature. It cannot take abilities away from a creature; you cannot change a creature’s fundamental nature.

_Third Syllable:_ You can alter a thing completely, turning one thing into another thing. You might change a horse into a rock, or a man into a tapestry. At the GM’s discretion, this might change the thing’s aspects completely to suit its new form.

#### TIME

You can cause your spells to last for greater periods of time. When you cast a spell without incorporating this word, it lasts only as long as you can see the target.

_First Syllable:_ The spell lasts until sunrise.

_Second Syllable:_ The spell lasts for a year and a day.

_Third Syllable:_ The spell is permanent unless something prematurely ends it, which you can do with a verbal command regardless of distance.
