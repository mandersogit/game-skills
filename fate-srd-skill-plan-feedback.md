# Feedback on `fate-srd-skill-plan.md` (top-level SRD-to-agent plan)

## Context
The current plan outlines a process for converting every Fate SRD into Claude agent skills, emphasizing coverage, taxonomy, and spec compliance but leaves room for multiple interpretations of what the "skills" teach.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L3-L74】 Earlier confusion arose from treating "skills" as in-universe Fate character abilities rather than agent-facing gameplay assistance.

## Where the assignment can be clearer
- **Define the learner and objective up front:** State that skills are agent-facing modules to run or assist tabletop sessions (rules tutoring, adjudication, pacing, safety), not catalogues of Fate character skills.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L3-L24】
- **Make the target outputs explicit:** Call out SKILL.md deliverables as facilitation/how-to play aids with progressive disclosure, instead of neutral content extraction from SRDs.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L25-L45】【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L70-L74】
- **Embed coverage expectations by play responsibility:** Add a checklist that requires table setup, session flow, conflict/scene tools, calibration/safety, and GM ops in addition to mechanical topics, so gameplay support is first-class.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L15-L41】
- **Clarify audience and tone:** Specify whether each skill should be written for agents assisting humans live, for GM prep, or for dual use, and set the expected brevity/actionability consistent with the Agent Skills spec.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L5-L13】【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L32-L35】
- **Show mapping for both rule coverage and play experience:** Extend the coverage index concept to track not only SRD section links but also which play responsibilities (safety, pacing, adjudication, teaching) each skill satisfies.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L37-L74】
- **Add non-goals to prevent regression:** Note that listing Fate character skills or stunt catalogs is out of scope except as examples supporting facilitation guidance, to avoid the earlier misunderstanding.【F:fate-srd-skill-plan.md†L46-L69】

## Suggested additions (without changing the plan yet)
Add a short preamble that defines the audience, desired deliverable shape, mandatory play-support coverage, and non-goals, plus a dual-index template (SRD sections ↔ play responsibilities) to guide contributors before they start inventorying and templating skills.
