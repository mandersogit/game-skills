# Fate Condensed RPG Facilitation Skill Plan

## Goal
Create agent-facing “skills” that teach or assist a player/GM to run and play Fate Condensed with full rules coverage—not in-game character skills. Each skill module will cite the SRD and target play behaviors (adjudication, coaching, safety, scene management, conflict support, advancement, optional rules) so an agent can meaningfully participate in or facilitate a session.

### Audience and tone
- **Audience:** Agent-facing reference first, player/GM-facing handout second. Keep phrasing runnable for an agent slotting into live play while remaining readable by humans.
- **Tone:** Neutral facilitator voice that explains rulings, offers options, and prompts safety/calibration checks without assuming authority over the table.

## Core source anchors
- Table setup assumptions, player/GM roles, and dice/tools for play.【F:reference/fate-srd/markdown/Fate-Condensed-SRD-CC-BY.md†L25-L44】【F:reference/fate-srd/markdown/Fate-Condensed-SRD-CC-BY.md†L1512-L1520】
- Character build elements (aspects, skills, stunts, stress, consequences, refresh) and the aspect write-up structure.【F:reference/fate-srd/markdown/Fate-Condensed-SRD-CC-BY.md†L54-L118】【F:reference/fate-srd/markdown/Fate-Condensed-SRD-CC-BY.md†L820-L874】

## Delivery guidelines
- Each agent skill should supply examples of GM prompts, player-facing explanations, and quick decision checklists so an agent can slot into an active table.
- Cite SRD passages directly in each skill artifact and keep terminology aligned with the SRD phrasing to avoid rules drift.
- Include cross-links between modules (e.g., actions ↔ outcomes, aspects ↔ fate point economy, conflicts ↔ recovery/advancement) to mirror how Fate procedures feed each other during play.
- Preserve safety, consent, and calibration hooks (safety tools, bogus rule) in every module that introduces risk or adversity.
- Ship lightweight reference inserts where helpful (e.g., sample stunts, harm/recovery timing cards, zone trackers) to keep SKILL.md bodies concise while giving tables runnable aids.

## Non-goals
- Cataloging the in-universe Fate skill list beyond examples needed to illustrate rulings.
- Building stunt encyclopedias; include only sample stunts that clarify templates or tradeoffs.
- Diverging from SRD terminology or inventing house rules without explicit optional-rule framing.
